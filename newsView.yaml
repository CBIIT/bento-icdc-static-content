      develop downstream technologies that may lead to discoveries that address

    label: Lorem Ipsum
    blurb: Summary of paragraph
  - paragraph: >-
      Certain datasets made available in ICDC will have an embargo period as an
      associated publication is in the process of being accepted and or
      published.  An embargo is the release of limited metadata on the ICDC
      portal until an approval is obtained from the respective data submitter.
      There are several visual icons intended to flag studies that have an
      active embargo to inform users that the data will be released to ICDC in
      the near future.
